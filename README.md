# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This application allows you to search for a city and return the current and future weather conditions of that city from the Open Weather API

### What I learned
In the process of creating this project I learned how to perform API calls on server-side APIs while using the Open Weather API.

## Usage

The webpage can be found at [this link](https://carol-tsai.github.io/weather-dashboard/)

When you arrive at this page, the panel on the right side of the page will have a search bar where you can search for a city.

When you enter a city and click search, that city will appear in the search history under the search bar, and the current weather as well as the 5 day forecast will be displayed for that city. The UVI index will have a background color that indicates good, moderate, or bad UV conditions, which can inform you of the level of sun protection needed currently.

The cities that you search will be stored in local storage and displayed on the right hand panel. You can click on cities in your search history to see updated weather for those cities.
