## Description

This application will test your knowledge of the Harry Potter universe through a timed quiz. By saving your score you can play this quiz with your friends to find out who is a true wizarding master. 

### What I learned
In the process of creating this project I learned to write HTML dynamically using Javascript, how to use timers, and how to save things to local storage.

## Usage

The webpage can be found at [this link](https://carol-tsai.github.io/harry-potter-quiz/)

When you arrive at this page, there will be some basic instructions. Read them thoroughly and click start quiz when you are ready to begin. The timer will begin once you click start.

Once the quiz starts, answer the questions as quickly as possible in order to get the highest score. When you are done, you will be prompted to save your score by entering your iniitals.

Your score will be saved in local storage so that when you leave this page and return, your score will be saved.
